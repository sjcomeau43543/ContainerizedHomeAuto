# Fan controller and Sensor to control the fan

## Fan Controller

The fan controller waits for a singal from the Bluetooth module to either turn the fan on or off.


## Temperature / Humidity Sensor

The sensor reads current data using the sensor on the board and prints data to stdout on the Serial monitor.
